  		<h1>The Giant Squid</h1>
  		<p>

			The <b>giant squid</b> (genus: <i>Architeuthis</i>) is a deep-ocean dwelling squid in the 
			family <i>Architeuthidae</i>, represented by as many as eight species. Giant squid 
			can grow to a tremendous size (see <i>Deep-sea gigantism</i>): recent estimates put 
			the maximum size at 13 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr> (43 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) for females and 10 
			<abbr title="meters">m</abbr> (33<abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) for males from 
			the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles (second only to the 
			colossal squid at an estimated 14 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr> (46 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>), one of the largest living 
			organisms). The mantle is about 2 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr> (6.6 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) long (more for females, less 
			for males), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles is about 5 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr> 
			(16 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>). Claims of specimens measuring 20 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr> (66 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) 
			or more have not been scientifically documented.<br/>
			On the 30<sup>th</sup> of September 2004, researchers from the <acronym title= "Museum of Nature and Science">
			NMNS</acronym> of Tokyo, Japan and the <acronym title = "Ogasawara Whale Watching Association">
			OWA</acronym> took the first images of a <em>live</em> giant squid in its natural habitat. Several of the 556 
			photographs were released a year later. The <acronym title= "Museum of Nature and Science">
			NMNS</acronym> and <acronym title = "Ogasawara Whale Watching Association">
			OWA</acronym> successfully filmed 
			a live <em>adult</em> giant squid for the first time on the 4<sup>th</sup> of December 2006.
